title: Migration off of BOX.com for GDPR
path: /migration-off-box.com
date: 2018-08-15
summary: BOXDue to GDPR and security concerns with BOX, the mother company demanded our LoB to cease or face fines. Using the BOX API service, I was able to create a scalable process to move all company data successfully from box.com to Microsoft's O365 onedrive.com solution.

> BOX.com - a storage collaboration cloud service which we were heavily leveraging could not comply with the required corporate minimum security baseline (MSB). In addition to secure our data using TLS 1.2 or above the GDPR mandate with compliance was yet another gap for this service. We had to migrate all data and ensure compliance by May 2018 otherwise face significant penalties. 

### Project goals

- **Minimize disruption to active business groups** - Partner with business groups via direct communication channels about project directives. Establish a working model and direction.
- **Design develop and deliver working solution** - I was in Germany for business when our IT directors reach out to me to solve this issue for them. I had approximately 6 weeks when I returned to complete the initial phase of the project.
- **4+ terabytes of data** - The company amassed large volumes of data stored on this service. Some was the volume of data was corporate individuals storing critical files for colaboration, sharing and backup purposes. The data for these teams were important to preserve and replicate on MS SharePoint.
- **Scalable Programming Model** - To effectively meet the short timeline and not disrupt individuals (minimize transition time) I had to leverage a highly scalable asynchronous process to migrate files. It was important to keep the migration window to just a few days (weekend migration period). Use of Node JS was important to create the required scalable solution to meet the cutover window. 
- **Vue.js for frontend** - A lightweight and approachable front-end framework.
- **Auto-optimized code** - Get code-splitting and asset optimization out-of-the-box.
- **Static files generation** - Deploy securely to any CDN or static web host.

### Prerequisites
You should have basic knowledge about HTML, CSS, [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and how to use the [Terminal](https://www.linode.com/docs/tools-reference/tools/using-the-terminal/). Knowing how [Vue Single File components](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html) & [GraphQL](https://www.graphql.com/) works is a plus, but not required. Gridsome is a great way to learn both.

Gridsome requires **Node.js** and recommends **Yarn**. [How to setup](/docs/prerequisites)

### 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool

Using yarn:
`yarn global add @gridsome/cli`

Using npm:
`npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

### 2. Create a Gridsome project

1. `gridsome create my-gridsome-site` to create a new project </li>
2. `cd my-gridsome-site` to open folder
3. `gridsome develop` to start local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`
4. Happy coding ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ

### 3. Next steps

1. Create `.vue` components in the `/pages` directory to create page routes.
2. Use `gridsome build` to generate static files in a `/dist` folder
