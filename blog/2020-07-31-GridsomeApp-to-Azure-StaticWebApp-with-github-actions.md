> Setup your Gridsome app in github with actions. This is relatively new with MS Build 2020 June. Static Web apps were also announced during this period. This is how I was able - with the help of several excellent websites (see below list) to set this up.

### Settings

- **GOTO: settings via Preferences:Settings:Extentions:HTML**
- **Set wrap line length to zero** - Format: Wrap Line Length
Maximum amount of characters per line (0 = disable).
- **GOTO: Extentions:Vetur:Format>Default Formatter:HTML** - Select 'prettyhtml' option.
- **BONUS: Set auto format on save** - Editor: Format on Save - 'enable' option. This will format your HTML document 'on save' with your default formatter.
